# etchsketch
This Etch-a-sketch project was completed toward the end of the foundations course on The Odin Project. 

Using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project will highlight what I've learned thus far.
The main focus of this project is DOM manipulation. If you would like to view the project requirements,
